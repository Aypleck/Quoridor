			<h2>The rules</h2>
			<p>Quoridor is played on a 9x9 grid, eahc player is represented by a pawn (Here represented by red a blue circles).</p>
			<p>The players play one after the other.</p>
			<h3>The goal</h3>
			<p>The goal is to be the first one to reach one of the nine tiles at the opposite side of the board.</p>
			<h3>The actions</h3>
			<p>During your turn, you have two possible actions :</p>
			<h4>Place a wall</h4>
			<p>Each players have 10 walls and can place them in the gap between the tiles of the board.</p>
			<p>A wall is two tiles long and can prevent a player from going from one tile to the other.</p>
			<p>You can't place a wall that prevents a player from winning completly, a wall can only extend the path to his victory.</p>
